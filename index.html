
The user wants a professional website about the topic "study depression" with around 10,000 words of content. The style should be professional and reminiscent of NASA's website style, which generally means clean, modern, with a lot of white space, good typography, a neutral color palette with blue accent colors, and a polished layout.

Since the user wants a full website, and I must follow the guidelines to create a single HTML file with inline CSS and JavaScript for frontend tasks, I will create one long HTML file that contains all the content well-structured into sections. The content must be about depression study, roughly 10,000 words.

Plan:
- Create a single HTML file.
- Style it professionally, using a NASA-style aesthetic: clean, modern, with a dark/navy blue color scheme, crisp typography, and spaced layout.
- Write the content divided into relevant sections such as Introduction, Symptoms, Causes, Impact, Study Methods, Treatments, Research, Resources, etc., so the content adds up to about 10,000 words.
- Include a navigation menu at the top for easy section navigation.
- Use good fonts, spacing, and a professional layout.
- Include smooth scrolling for navigation links.
- Include subtle interactive CSS or JS for modern look but not overwhelming.
- Make sure it looks polished and professional.

Let me prepare the full HTML file with inline CSS and JavaScript for this content and styling.

      <ul>
        <li>Reduced quality of life and diminished daily functioning</li>
        <li>Increased susceptibility to physical health problems like heart disease</li>
        <li>Elevated risk of suicide and self-harm</li>
        <li>Impaired relationships and social withdrawal</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>On Families and Communities</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Emotional strain within families and caregiving burdens</li>
